1. Sealed Classes and Interfaces
- Java 17 standardizes sealed classes and interfaces.
- It allows developers to restrict which other classes or interfaces can extend or implement them.
- This feature improves the integrity and maintainability of class hierarchies by controlling subclassing explicitly.
- For example, a sealed class can specify a fixed set of permitted subclasses, preventing unwanted extensions.

2. Pattern Matching for switch (Preview)
- This feature enhances switch statements and expressions with pattern matching.
- It allows more concise and readable code by matching objects against patterns directly in switch cases.
- It reduces boilerplate and improves expressiveness, supporting complex conditions and type checks within switch constructs.

3. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators
- Java 17 introduces a new set of interfaces and implementations.
- It is used for pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), including RandomGenerator and specialized interfaces such as SplittableRandomGenerator.
- This upgrade provides a uniform API for various PRNG algorithms and supports stream-based programming.
- It makes random number generation more flexible and powerful.

4. Removal of RMI Activation
- The Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Activation mechanism, deprecated earlier, is fully removed in Java 17.
- To simplify the platform and reduce maintenance overhead.

5. Restore Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics
- Java 17 restores strict IEEE 754 floating-point semantics by default.
- It ensures consistent and predictable floating-point calculations across platforms.

6. New macOS Rendering Pipeline
- Java 17 introduces a new rendering pipeline for macOS based on Apple's Metal API.
- It replaces the older pipeline.
- This change improves graphics performance and compatibility on modern macOS systems, including Apple Silicon Macs.

7. Vector API (Incubator)
- The Vector API enables developers to write vectorized computations.
- It leverage hardware SIMD instructions for improved performance in data-heavy operations.
- This API is incubated in Java 17, allowing experimentation and feedback before standardization.

8. Foreign-Memory Access API (Incubator)
- This API simplifies interaction with memory outside the Java heap.
- It facilitates safer and more efficient interoperability with native code and libraries, such as those written in C or C++.

9. Shenandoah Garbage Collector Improvements
- Java 17 includes enhancements to the Shenandoah garbage collector.
- It aims to reduce pause times and improve performance for large heap applications by performing concurrent and parallel garbage collection.

10. New Access-Level API for JDK Internals
- Java 17 introduces an API to better control access to internal JDK components.
- It helps developers safely use internal features without relying on unsupported or unsafe operations.

11. Deprecation of Security Manager and Applet API
- The Security Manager and the Applet API are deprecated in Java 17.
- It signals their removal in future releases.
- This reflects the evolving security model and the decline of applets in favor of modern web technologies.

12. New API for Large Icons and InstantSource Interface
- Java 17 adds new APIs to improve UI capabilities and time-source handling.
- Such as an interface for retrieving the current instant, enhancing time-based operations.
