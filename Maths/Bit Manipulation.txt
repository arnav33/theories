x * 2 = x << 1
x * 4 = x << 2
x * 2^i = x << i
LSB: List Signification Bit
LSB is 1 for odd and 0 for even
x & 1 == 1: x is odd
x & 1 == 0: x is even
ith bit is set or not. keep right shifting the number until we have checked the ith number
>>: right shifting
<<: left shifting
One's compliment: flip all bits
Two's compliment: add 1 to One's compliment
Two's compliment is used to represent negative of a number
1 << k = 2 ^ k
(x) & (x - 1) == 0 implies x is a power of 2
x^x = 0. x0r cancils out a pair
