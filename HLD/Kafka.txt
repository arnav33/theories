About
- Kafka is a distributed event streaming framework originally developed by LinkedIn.
- It enables publish-subscribe messaging, where producers publish events (messages) to topics, and consumers subscribe to those topics to process the events.
- Kafka stores events in an ordered, immutable log called a topic partition, ensuring message order within partitions.
- It supports horizontal scalability by distributing partitions across multiple servers called brokers.
- Kafka is designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and durability through replication of partitions.
- Yes, Apache Kafka is a messaging service, specifically a distributed publish-subscribe based durable messaging system.
- It enables applications to send (produce) and receive (consume) messages through topics, which act as categories or feeds for the messages.

Core concepts
- Broker: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients. Multiple brokers form a Kafka cluster.
- Topic: A category or feed name to which messages are published. Topics are split into partitions.
- Partition: A topic is divided into partitions for scalability and parallelism. Each partition is an ordered log.
- Producer: Client application that publishes messages to Kafka topics.
- Consumer: Client application that subscribes to topics and processes messages.
- Offset: A unique sequential ID assigned to messages within a partition, used to track consumption.
- Replication: Kafka replicates partitions across brokers to ensure fault tolerance.

How Kafka Works
- Producers send messages to a topic. Messages may have keys to determine which partition they go to, preserving order for messages with the same key.
- Kafka stores messages in partitions on brokers as immutable logs.
- Consumers pull messages from partitions and process them. They track their position using offsets.
- Kafka uses Zookeeper (or newer Kafka Raft metadata mode) for cluster coordination and managing broker metadata.
- Kafka supports stream processing via its Streams API and integrates with tools like Apache Spark, Flink, and Storm.

Key Features
- High throughput and low latency for real-time data streaming.
- Durability: Messages are persisted to disk and replicated.
- Scalability: Easily add brokers and partitions to scale.
- Fault tolerance: Automatic failover and replication.
- Ordering guarantees within partitions.
- Multiple consumers can read from the same topic independently.

Typical Use Cases
- Real-time analytics and monitoring.
- Log aggregation.
- Event sourcing and CQRS architectures.
- Data integration pipelines.
- Messaging backbone for microservices.

Getting Started: Basic Steps
- Install Java (Kafka runs on JVM).
- Download and extract Kafka.
- Start Zookeeper (Kafkaâ€™s cluster manager).
- Start Kafka broker.
- Commands
    - Create a topic: kafka-topics.sh --create --topic MyTopic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    - Start a producer to send messages: kafka-console-producer.sh --topic MyTopic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
    - Start a consumer to read messages: kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic MyTopic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
- Summary
