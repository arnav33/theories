1. Sequencial actions
    - Action 1: m ways
    - Action 2: n ways
    - Total number of ways: m x n

2. OR
    - Task A: m ways
    - Task B: n ways
    - Total number of ways: m + n - overlap

3. Combinations: Selection
    - nCr = n!/r!(n - r)!
    - nCr = nCn-r
    - nC0 = 1
    - nCn = 1
    - nC1 = n
    - 0! = 1
    - nCr = n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr: forms Pascal triangle
    - nCr % m = (n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr) % m
