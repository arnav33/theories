Data Types
    Primitive (promotion, demotion(typecasting) - variables, default)
        Integral (range, circularity)
            type
                byte: 1 byte = 8 bits
                short: 2 byte = 16 bits
                int: 4 byte = 32 bits
                long: 8 bite = 64 bits
            representation
                -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1
                positive numbers are represented in binary
                negative numbers are represented in 2's compliment of binaries
        Floating
            float
            double
        Other
            char: 0: 48, A: 65, a: 97
            boolean
    Non-Primitive (Reference)
        String
            literal pool / interl pool

Operators
    >=, <=, ==, >, <. !=

Generics
    covariance: f(A) extends f(B)
    contravarience
    invarience

Collection Primitives
    List: Ordered
    Set: Unique
    Queue: FIFO
    Map: key-value

    Map
        HashMap: 
        LinkedHashMap: ordered keys
        TreeMap:
    Stack -> vector -> AbstractList -> AbstractCollection - thread safe
    Collection
        List
            ArrayList: Indexed access
            LinkedList: Direct index access not needed. Faster insert.
            Vector: threadsafe. slower than arraylist.
                Stack
        Queue
            LinkedList
            ArrayDeque: insert / remove on both ends. not thread safe
            PriorityQueue: ordered queueing
        Set
            HashSet: stores uniquely, searches in O(1)
            TreeSet: ordered, thread safe
            LinkedHashSet: ordered, thread unsafe

Iterable
Iterator
Streams
Consumers: (arg) => sout(arg)
Supplier: () => return "Hello"
Predicate: (arg) => return arg
BiConsumer
Bipredicate
Runnable
Comparable
Comparator

Program
Process: memory, processing power are required at bare minimum. i/0 devices
Process = Momory + Thread

Executor Service Framework(task -> worker thread) -> OS Schedulars(software thread -> hardware thread) -> (SMT, HT)(cores -> cpu)
Task: A unit of work
SMT: Simultanious Multithreading
MT: Multithreading
Concurrency Frameworks run on every layer

CPU = Control Unit (Which task, accessing the ram, accessing I/O devices, controlling clock) + Registers (an immediate memory) + cores(Calculations and Computaitons)
cores = ALU + GPU + Neural Networks
types of cores
    SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data. Used by GPU
    TPU: Tensor Processing Unit
    ALU: Arithmetic Logic Units
