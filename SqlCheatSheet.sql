-- 1. QUERYING SINGLE TABLE
    SELECT * FROM country; -- 1.1 Fetch all columns from the country table:
    SELECT id, name FROM city; -- Fetch id and name columns from the city table:
    SELECT name FROM city ORDER BY rating [ASC]; -- Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the default ASCending order:
    SELECT name FROM city ORDER BY rating DESC; -- Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the DESCending order:

-- 2. Aliases
    SELECT name AS city_name FROM city; -- Columns
    SELECT co.name, ci.name FROM city AS ci JOIN country AS co ON ci.country_id = co.id; -- Tables

-- 3. FILTERING THE OUTPUT
    -- 3.1 COMPARISON OPERATORS
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE rating > 3; -- Fetch names of cities that have a rating above 3:
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE name != 'Berlin' AND name != 'Madrid'; -- Fetch names of cities that are neither Berlin nor Madrid:

    -- 3.2 TEXT OPERATORS
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE name LIKE 'P%' OR name LIKE '%s'; -- Fetch names of cities that start with a 'P' or end with an 's':
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE name LIKE '_ublin'; -- Fetch names of cities that start with any letter followed by 'ublin' (like Dublin in Ireland or Lublin in Poland):

    -- 3.3 OTHER OPERATORS
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE population BETWEEN 500000 AND 5000000; -- Fetch names of cities that have a population between 500K and 5M:
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE rating IS NOT NULL; -- Fetch names of cities that don't miss a rating value:
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE country_id IN (1, 4, 7, 8); -- Fetch names of cities that are in countries with IDs 1, 4, 7, or 8:

-- 4. QUERYING MULTIPLE TABLES

    -- 4.1 INNER JOIN - JOIN (or explicitly INNER JOIN) returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city [INNER] JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.id;

    -- 4.2 LEFT JOIN - LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table with corresponding rows from the right table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the second table.
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city LEFT JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.id; 

    -- 4.3 RIGHT JOIN - RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table with corresponding rows from the left table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the left table.
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city RIGHT JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.id;

    -- 4.4 FULL JOIN - FULL JOIN (or explicitly FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from both tables â€“ if there's no matching row in the second table, NULLs are returned.
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city FULL [OUTER] JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.id;

    -- 4.5 CROSS JOIN - CROSS JOIN returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables. There are two syntaxes available.
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city CROSS JOIN country;
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city, country;

    -- 4.6 NATURAL JOIN - NATURAL JOIN will join tables by all columns with the same name. - rarely used in practice
    SELECT city.name, country.name FROM city NATURAL JOIN country;

-- 5. AGGREGATION AND GROUPING
-- 5.1 GROUP BY groups together rows that have the same values in specified columns. It computes summaries (aggregates) for each unique combination of values.

-- 5.2 AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
    avg(expr) - average value for rows within the group
    count(expr) - count of values for rows within the group
    max(expr) - maximum value within the group
    min(expr) - minimum value within the group
    sum(expr) - sum of values within the group

    -- EXAMPLE QUERIES

    -- Find out the number of cities:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM city;

    --Find out the number of cities with non-null ratings:
    SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM city;

    -- Find out the number of distinctive country values:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_id) FROM city;

    -- Find out the smallest and the greatest country populations:
    SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population) FROM country;

    -- Find out the total population of cities in respective countries:
    SELECT country_id, SUM(population) FROM city GROUP BY country_id;

    -- Find out the average rating for cities in respective countries if the average is above 3.0:
    SELECT country_id, AVG(rating) FROM city GROUP BY country_id HAVING AVG(rating) > 3.0;

-- 6. SUBQUERIES - A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query, or inside another subquery. There are different types of subqueries.

    -- 6.1. SINGLE VALUE - The simplest subquery returns exactly one column and exactly one row. It can be used with comparison operators =, <, <=, >, or >=.

    -- This query finds cities with the same rating as Paris:
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE rating = (
    SELECT rating
    FROM city
    WHERE name = 'Paris'
    );

    -- 6.2. MULTIPLE VALUES - A subquery can also return multiple columns or multiple rows. Such subqueries can be used with operators IN, EXISTS, ALL, or ANY.
    -- This query finds cities in countries that have a population above 20M:
    SELECT name FROM city WHERE country_id IN (
    SELECT country_id
    FROM country
    WHERE population > 20000000
    );

    -- 6.3. CORRELATED -- A correlated subquery refers to the tables introduced in the outer query. A correlated subquery depends on the outer query. It cannot be run independently from the outer query.
    -- This query finds cities with a population greater than the average population in the country:
    SELECT * FROM city main_city WHERE population > (
    SELECT AVG(population)
    FROM city average_city
    WHERE average_city.country_id = main_city.country_id
    );

    -- This query finds countries that have at least one city:
    SELECT name FROM country WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM city
    WHERE country_id = country.id
    );

-- 7. SET OPERATIONS -- Set operations are used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result. The combined queries must return the same number of columns and compatible data types. The names of the corresponding columns can be different

    -- 7.1. UNION - UNION combines the results of two result sets and removes duplicates. UNION ALL doesn't remove duplicate rows.
    -- This query displays German cyclists together with German skaters:
    SELECT name FROM cycling WHERE country = 'DE'
    UNION / UNION ALL
    SELECT name FROM skating WHERE country = 'DE';

    -- 7.2. INTERSECT - INTERSECT returns only rows that appear in both result sets.
    -- This query displays German cyclists who are also German skaters at the same time:
    SELECT name FROM cycling WHERE country = 'DE'
    INTERSECT
    SELECT name FROM skating WHERE country = 'DE';

    -- 7.3. EXCEPT - EXCEPT returns only the rows that appear in the first result set but do not appear in the second result set.
    -- This query displays German cyclists unless they are also German skaters at the same time:

    SELECT name FROM cycling WHERE country = 'DE'
    EXCEPT / MINUS
    SELECT name FROM skating WHERE country = 'DE';`
